"""
Snake, Water, Gun is a variation of the children's game rock-paper-scissors. Players use hand gestures to represent a snake, water, or a gun. The gun shoots the snake (gun wins), water extinguishes the gun (water wins), and the snake drinks the water (snake wins). Write a Python program to create a Snake Water Gun game using if-else statements. We will avoid fancy GUIs and use functions to determine the winner.
